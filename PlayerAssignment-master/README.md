With more time, I consider the following edge cases:

Error handling: Implement proper error handling and return meaningful error messages for more scenarios.
Input validation: Validate input parameters, such as player IDs, to ensure they are in the correct format and exist.

Also, for documantation, I would prefer using a dedicated tool, like Swagger. also using Javadoc for code documentation.
